# Brainstorming Ideas (Step 1)
#### Mobile Leetcode
- It's leetcode, but mobile. I'm a masochist and want to be able to leetcode on my phone without having to use the browser.
#### Haircut Recommender
- I want users to be able to take a picture of their face and my app will recommend haircuts that fit their face shape.
#### Sports Pick'em
- I want users to be able to track their sports knowledge by simply predicting wins of sports games and then having that data tracked. It's sports gambling, but instead of money it's bragging rights.

# Evaluated Ideas (Step 2)
## Mobile Leetcode
#### Mobile
- What makes your app more than a glorified website?
    - The app would be more than a glorified website because apps are more convenient to use than websites on the phone. Especially apps that you might want to use once a day or so. 
- Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc.
    - The app would send notifications to remind you to do your daily Leetcode questions.
    - A feature could be implemented so that code written out by hand can be scanned into the app by the camera to simulate what whiteboard interviews would be like.

#### Story
- How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
    - The value of the app to my audience is clear. It allows the massive job market of Computer Science and related fields to be able to conveniently do Leetcode-like problems. I personally am not always near my laptop.
- How well would your freinds or peers respond to this product idea?
    - My peers would respond positively to this idea because the problem I am addressing would make their life a lot easier when they wanna grind Leetcode.
#### Market
- What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
    - According to [DataUSA](https://datausa.io/profile/cip/computer-science-110701), 2.32 million people are in the field of Computer Science. The amount of people that should be staying Leetcode sharp should be 2.32 million people because I think in today's current job climate it's always better to be safe and prepared.
- Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
    - I think this app would provide huge value to the people who actively do Leetcode because this would allow them to do it anywhere as long as there is internet. Times where you could be waiting in an elevator or commuting on public transportation.
- Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
    - The audience of the app would be people who currently Leetcode and want more convenient ways to do enhance their skills or people who struggle with the convenience of a computer, but want to maintain consistency to enhance their technical interview skills.

#### Habit
- How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
    - The average user might open and use this app once a day. Complete their daily Leetcode question and then call it a day.
- Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
    - The vision would be for users to be able to consume the information of technical interview-like questions and create solutions to those questions like Leetcode

#### Scope
- How technically challenge will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
    - This app can have a lot of features built in to it for the purpose of time. My implementation will be a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that will implement seeing the daily question, a list of questions, something that will allow users to select questions they have finished, and a notification system that will tell users to complete their daily question if they haven't selected that they have completed by a certain time.
- Is a stripped down version of this app still interesting to build?
    - The stripped down version of this app has a lot of interesting points. I think building a list of questions, displaying the daily question, and selecting finished questions will be iterating on topics we've learned in class; however, implementing a notification system will be something new that I will have to learn on my own.
- How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
    - It's clearly defined as I have provided a list of features that I will be implementing to have an MVP.

## Sports Pick'em
#### Mobile
- What makes your app more than a glorified website?
    - Sports Pick'em would have features that set it apart from a website. The app would send a push notification in real-time whenever a sports pick resolves and the pick is correct!

#### Story
- How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
    - The value is not huge for this app. This would be almost like a game so that you can keep track of who's better at predicting games between you and your friends or even the world.
- How well would your freinds or peers respond to this product idea?
    - My friends would respond well because this is something that me and my friends have been wanting to do for a long time

#### Market
- What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
    - My vision is mostly centered around my friend group, but this could potentially reach anyone interested in sports which could be up to billions of people in the world.
- Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
    - I don't think this app provides huge value to a niche group of people. This is more of a nice fun thing to have.
- Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
    - My idea is for my friends, but this could reach all sports fans.

#### Habit
- How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
    - I would imagine the average user to open this app once a week to make their picks.
- Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
    - They would just consume my app because all they would do is predict a slew of games for the week and then wait till the games are played and see if they are correct.

#### Scope
- How technically challenge will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
    - I think the biggest technical challenge would be finding the information and the odds to provide to the users of each match up. I've played around with trying to find such APIs and most are pay walled. Another technical challenge would be implementing a way to do notifications so that users will know in real time if there pick was right or not.
- Is a stripped down version of this app still interesting to build?
    - I think the app itself is pretty simple and not super feature heavy so I think building the full app would be interesting.
- How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
    - I know what exactly I want to build so it is clearly defined.
